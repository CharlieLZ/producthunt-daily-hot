# My Open Source Domain Story: A Brand, Product, and Growth Journey from a "Non-Programmer" E-commerce Operator

Hi, I'm Charlie.

To be honest, I'm not a programmer. I don't know products, traffic, operations, marketing, or branding. My main job is Amazon e-commerce operations, as a third-party seller. I'm an outsider to the Internet, code, products, and brands. I grew up in an ordinary family and didn't touch a computer until college. At that time, I was curious about Python and programming, but the theory was too boring, and I couldn't get into video courses. Even now, five years after graduation, I still can't code, but I've always had respect and gratitude for "code."

---

## Why this open source project?

Honestly, I didn't understand open source, branding, copyright, traffic, or products at first. I was just an e-commerce operator, doing business under platform rules, feeling it was getting harder, and wanting to find a new way out. One day, I discovered Product Hunt, with so many new products, ideas, and trends every day. I was curious about the data, innovations, and logic behind these products. So I started researching, even "borrowing" the brand, bought a .ai domain, just because it sounded good, and put up an open source navigation project. The data wasn't much different from others. Later, I found that even with little traffic, Google indexed it. This made me realize that even a small attempt can be seen by the world.

But I wasn't satisfied with "copy-paste." I wanted to create something of my own. So I started thinking: can I use this domain to make an open source project that aggregates product data, APIs, and registration info, maybe even a "dashboard" for more people to use and see?

---

## Brand, Copyright, and Risk: My "Late Realization" and Respect

Frankly, I had no concept of brand, copyright, or domain risk at first. I just thought the brand was cool, the domain was handy, so I bought it. I didn't check trademarks or have brand awareness, just thought it was fun. Later, I realized there are risks, especially with well-known brands.

I used this brand's app data and products, indeed "borrowed" some brand heat, but had no malicious intent. I just wanted to do something interesting in my own way and study the data and trends of these innovative products.

Now I respect brands and copyrights very much, and I'm willing to make all project content public, with no commercial purpose or malice. **This article is to clearly express my respect for the brand, domain, and website. All my project content is open and transparent, with no malice or commercial purpose.** If the brand owner ever wants the domain back, I'll transfer it to them. After all, it's their brand, and I'm just a "dreamer passing by." But before that, I hope to use this domain to create something valuable, even if it's just an open source sample room.

## My Growth and Identity: Facing My "Ignorance" Honestly

I'm not a product manager, programmer, traffic expert, marketing guru, or brand specialist. I'm just an ordinary e-commerce operator, relying on understanding rules and a bit of execution on Amazon. I'm interested in code but never learned it. I'm interested in products but never made one. I don't understand branding, traffic, marketing, or copyright. But I believe that as long as you're willing to try, learn, and experiment, even "cross-industry," you can create something interesting.

## Open Source, Donation, and Personal Brand: My Little Plan

I always felt the greatest charm of open source is not the code itself, but the connection between people. I hope to meet more like-minded friends through this project, even if it's just remote communication, it's a gain.

If one day this project gets some attention, I'll proactively contact the brand owner and express my willingness to donate. Not to "sell for a good price," but to tell a story of "open source, sharing, and win-win." Maybe they won't care, maybe they'll think I'm overdoing it, but that's okay. The important thing is I did what I wanted and left myself a memorable experience.

---

## Operation and Strategy: My Pragmatism

1. **Focus on content and technology**: Regardless of whether the domain can be sold, the project itself must be valuable.
2. **Improve documentation and story**: Write my intentions, story, and donation willingness clearly in the README, project homepage, and blog.
3. **Develop several related projects**: Form my own "open source product matrix" to enhance personal influence.
4. **Fixed contact information**: Use a dedicated email and Twitter account for easy contact with brand owners and developers.
5. **Don't worry or stress**: Decide whether to renew or give up the domain when it expires, go with the flow.
6. **If the brand owner wants the domain, I'll transfer it and write a good story, positive marketing.**  But more importantly, this article is to express my respect for the brand and cherish the domain‚Äî**I'm not using this domain for big business, but to leave something interesting for the brand, the industry, and myself through this project.**  If the brand owner needs it, I can transfer the domain to them at any time; if not, I'll keep renewing and maintaining the project until one day it's really valuable and worth attention.
7. **If the account is banned, it means I did something wrong, adjust in time, never violate the rules.**
8. **If no one cares about the project, treat it as practice and slowly build influence.**
9. **If all goes well, keep going and enjoy the fun of open source.**

## My Bottom Line and Dedication

- All content of this project is public, with no malice or commercial purpose.
- I'm always willing to donate the domain to the brand owner, even if they don't care now, they can contact me anytime in the future.
- I wrote this article to clarify my thoughts, story, bottom line, respect, and dedication.
- I believe the most valuable thing in life is the products and stories you leave behind.
- **My biggest motivation for this project is to make more products. For me, the greatest meaning in life is to turn my ideas into good products. Even a small open source project is worth taking seriously.**

## Conclusion: Be Yourself, Do Open Source with Warmth

I'm not a big shot or an influencer, just an ordinary person who likes to tinker. But I believe that as long as you do things with heart, even a small open source project can shine. I hope my story can inspire you, and you're welcome to communicate, complain, or collaborate.

**Open source is not just code, but the warmth between people.**
